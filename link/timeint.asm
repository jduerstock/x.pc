;* VOID timer2_int()
;*
;*     This function is the main timer interrupt processor, called when
;*     returning from all other timer processing (DOS, Int 1C, and all
;*     who preempted these before we did.) via the sneaky trick of
;*     placing a fake interrupt call on the stack, with the return address
;*     pointing to the beginning of this routine.
;*
;*     The routine saves the registers and decrements 1/6th second timers.
;*     If a software lock is set, it then restores the registers and
;*     returns.  Otherwise, it sets the lock, reassigns the stack to our
;*     own location, since the interrupted program may not have had much
;*     stack available; and calls timeout and link level processing.  After
;*     timeout and link processing are complete, it restores the stack,
;*     clears the software lock, restores the registers, and returns.
;*     
;* Notes: This is NOT a C callable function.  For that matter, it should
;*     not be directly called by ANY function, but called only in the
;*     manner described above.  Further note that timeout processing
;*     (in do_timers()) and link level processing (in do_link()) run with
;*     interrupts ENABLED.  Timer interrupts will be blocked here.  Comm
;*     interrupts should be provided for, where necessary.
;*
;* Returns: None.

;************************************************************************
;* VOID timer_int()
;*
;*     This function is the initial timer interrupt function called at
;*     a hardware timer interrupt.  It's sole function is to set up a
;*     fake interrupt on the stack so that when the BIOS interrupt handler
;*     returns, it will end up in timer2_int(), instead of the originally
;*     interrupted program.  It then directly jumps to the address which
;*     the original timer interrupt vector had been pointing to. (Which
;*     should be the BIOS, or another program which has preempted the
;*     BIOS)
;*
;*     This function simply passes the interrupt on to the original timer
;*     interrupt vector if the flag "xpc_timer_active" is false (ie., 0).
;*     This is for support for the "-T" flag for programs which use the
;*     0x8 timer vector.
;*
;* Notes: Again, this is NOT a C Callable function.  Do not call directly.
;*     Interrupts are disabled at this point due to the automatic
;*     disabling of interrupts upon receipt of a hardware interrupt.
;*
;* Returns:  <list all possible returns and their meanings, one to a line>
